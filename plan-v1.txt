Sprint Ideas

Ideas discussed in first meeting:
-- cache to save for now
-- later: login, database
-- query selector can be used for retrieving data from tables 
-- start up page is the most important
-- theme is important and has to be modular (easy to change)
	- define themes using CSS variables
	- refer to variables in the classes 



Features we have to incorporate: 
-- start up page flow
-- mathematical calculations: 
		- loan, principal, interest
		- daily interest 
		- per payment: amount paid on principal and amount on interest
		- interest gained between payments (do we show this on graph)
-- data analytics:
		- graphing the data: total current loan, total interest paid, principal remaining 
		- projections: maybe use a dotted line 
-- cool front-end effects: 
		- gradients on the page
		- lines appearing on the graph one-by-one, rendering slowly


We need to discuss:
	-- UI Components: somebody has to draw them up
	-- tabling structure: somebody has to draw them up  
	-- can we work with multiple loans ?? -- think about storage and UI 
	-- sprints: 
			- format --     Sprint Number 	 | Ali's Feature | Jibran's Feature | Tanjim's Feature | 
			- we need to think about the order that we do things
			- us working on seperate React components may help 
			- maybe- 
				SPRINT 1
				Person A. front-end and caching data -- use dummy data to see how it works 
				Person B. storing different loans creating tables and making calculations 
				Person C. creating graphs -- use dummy data 

				meeting: explain how to use each other's stuff. We can discord livestream. 

				SPRINT 2 
				Person A. positioning the tables and graphs UI wise -- can use dummy data 
				Person B. reading data from cache 
				Person C. integration and styling graphs, creating backend 

				meeting
