# Variable Payment Interest Tracker

Most competitor interest calculators only allow fixed payment interest amortization schedules. 

This is not very realistic, as the majority of middle-class Americans are struggling to pay their bills and often cannot consistently make payments. 

Interest tracker is a visualization tool that caters to people that are more dynamic with their payments. It is built purely on React

It allows users to: 
    -- generate standard fix-payment loan schedules 
    -- to add varyimg payments for a more dynamic schedule 
    -- see how much interest and principal each payment knocks off 
    -- and see the total amount paid overall, as well as total interest for both loans paid with a fixed amount, and loans paid off dynamicslly 
    


cool features:
    -- allows rows to be added to the table dynamically  
    -- lets all values for the month update according to the user's input and previous payments  
    -- ensures that inappropriate values are not added
    -- terminate input ability when loan is completed
