# Variable Payment Interest Tracker

Most competitor interest calculators only allow fixed payment interest amortization schedules. 

This is not very realistic, as the majority of middle-class Americans are struggling to pay their bills and often cannot consistently make payments. 

Interest tracker is a visualization tool that caters to people that are more dynamic with their payments. It is built purely on React

It allows users to: 
    -- to dynamically add payments
    -- see how much interest and principal each payment knocks off 
    -- and see the total amount paid overall, as well as total interest

It can also output the fixed-rate amortization schedules that other competing calculators, but with more details.
